# Plum
Plum is a music player written entriely in Swift, build around AVAudioPlayer. It provides classic Apple Music interface that was abandoned during iOS8 era, but it doesn't simply bring everything people already seen, it comes with big amount of tweaks, cool customisation options, artwork based color-schemes, intuitive queue management, Spotlight searching and many other. 
It was made to make listening-to-music-on-iPhone great again
